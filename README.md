## FAQ

Q: I've pressed "F1" on the keyboard, but the about message box didn't show up. How can I get the program to show the message box when I pressed the "F1" key?

A: Some keyboards have got functions on the "F1-12" keys (especially when you're using the laptop), which is why you're not getting the about message box. This could be that the "FN Lock" is enabled. To workaround this, either disable it or press & hold the FN+F1 key and that should show the message box.
